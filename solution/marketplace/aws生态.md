## AWS生态

AWS 的成功不仅仅是它的方法论、产品和解决方案。任何一个云厂商能提供的产品和方案总是有限的，AWS 通过 AWS Marketplace 将产品和解决方案扩大到了更大的范围，从而更好的满足客户需求，增加客户黏性。

> ### 什么是 AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is an online store that helps customers find, buy, and immediately start using the software and services they need to build products and run their businesses. AWS Marketplace complements programs like the Amazon Partner Network and is another example of AWS’s commitment to growing a strong ecosystem of software and solution partners.
